# Textbox POC

Little textbox proof of concept used to mess around with F# / FABLE.  Draws a multiline text box and allows editing of the README.md file which is loaded via an async request.

TODO:
* Add size to model and remove hard-coded size
* Move by word
* Home/End
* Modify ensureVisible to scroll left/right
* Add selection and copy/cut/paste
* Repeat keys that are held down

IDEAS:
* Syntax highlighting
* Add VIM mode
* Load and save files (maybe from dropbox, google drive, etc.)
